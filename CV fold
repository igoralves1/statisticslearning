caret has a function for this:

require(caret)
flds <- createFolds(y, k = 10, list = TRUE, returnTrain = FALSE)
names(flds)[1] <- "train"
Then each element of flds is a list of indexes for each dataset. If your dataset is called dat, then  dat[flds$train,] gets you the training set, dat[ flds[[2]], ] gets you the second fold set, etc.
